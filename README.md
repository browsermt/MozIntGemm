# arm-playground

Need to support a backend for arm for bergamot-translator. Easy way is to integrate arm support into [intgemm](https://github.com/kpu/intgemm), copying over stuff from [ruy](https://github.com/google/ruy). This repository is meant to help with the task... or something. 

Objective: ASSERT(Multiply-By-Ruy = Multiply-By-Intgemm), on arm
